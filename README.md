Clients can keep track of each transaction they have, whther its money they receive or they have spent. A chart is then populated for easy visualization of the budget transactions.

### Offline


For the client's convenience, this website can continue to work offline and subtract and populate the chart. Data is stored in the indexDb until the client can get back online.
